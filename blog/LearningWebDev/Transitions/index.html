    <h2 class="content-title">Learning some Javascript!</h2>
    <p class="content-body" style="font-size: 19px;">
      <br> My website is PURELY HTML and CSS.. So for my first project outside of my website, I wanted to do something different. How about learn and apply some Javascript!? And that's what I did with my this project that I call <b><i><a href="../../../projects/transitions/" title="">Transitions</a></i></b> <br><br>So basically I wrote a very simple javascript function that changes the color of the background whenever you click on the <i>Click Me</i> button. Cool right? <br><br>Javascript is an actual programming language, unlike CSS and HTML - although some would argue that they are as well. Thanks to my Python knowledge, I was able to pick up a ton of the Javascript basics in no time as they, and most programiming languages, share alot of basic features. Such as for-loops, while-loops, variables, lists, strings, integers, floats, conditionals, classes and so on. <br><br>Javascript has a couple of unique features that I thought were pretty cool, like its amazing and time saving shorthands. <br> For example, a single-line arrow function doesn't need HALF of the code for a regular funtion due to its <i>assume return</i> feature. For simple boolean conditionals, you can write what's called a <i>Ternary</i> conditional statement also takes about half of the code a normal conditional would take. (I will edit this in the near future with example code to better illistrate). Another nice feature of Javascript, and most other languages for that matter, is that it isn't white space sensitive like Python is, but nested loops and conditions can get ugly <i> <b>real</b> </i> fast with all of those brackets. <br><br>

    <h2 class="content-title">My Coding Setup</h2>
    <p class="content-body" style="font-size: 19px;">
      Something I forgot to add to my first blog post, <a href="../MyFirstProject/" title="">My First Project</a>, was my dev setup. Basically, the software tools and processes I'm using to write and get my code to this website. <br><br>For my editor/IDE, I am using <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/" title="">SublimeText</a>, which is definitely one of my favorite IDE's so far. It's between Sublime and <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" title="">Visual Studio Code</a>, which is the open-source IDE from Microsoft. There is a slight caveat, if one is planning to use Sublime.. it is not free, coming in at a fairly hefty $80! There is an unlimited trial version that, of course, doesn't have all of the bells and whistles. Visual Studio Code is free, though, and is the IDE I would recommend for most beginners. What I like about Sublime, though, is that it has a TON of plugins and packages to create a powerful, yet still lightweight IDE that supports multiple languages. Two things I love most about it is the GoTo quick navigation feature and the Terminus plugin. Terminus is a terminal plugin that you can run in, etiher, it's own separate tab for some heavy duty CLI work or in a little bar at the bottom of the same tab as the code you're working on to run some quick git commands. Speaking of git... <br><br>For version control, I'm using the ever fantastic <i>git</i>, which is connected to my public repository in <a href="https://github.com/lpeaua/PeauaWebDev" title="">GitHub</a>. <br><br>For hosting, I chose to go with a $5/month Ubuntu server running in <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/" title="">DigitalOcean</a>. DigitalOcean is one of the cheapest, easiest and better quality of the other hosting options I've tried before and I HIGHLY recommend. <br><br> For CI/CD, Instead of going through the long - write code, git add, git commit, git push and then ssh onto the server and run git pull - OR instead of spending time configuring a CI/CD pipline with Jenkins and other services, I decided to just write a simple bash script that performs the git commands that push my code to the repo and then runs the git pull on my server all with a simple '<b>deploy</b>' command in terminal. I know it's not the best of practices, but time is of the essence! and I use git and GitHub every day at work, following strict policy and best prectices, so I feel like I can get away with it here!
