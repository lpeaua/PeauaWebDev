      <h2 class="content-title">My Why:</h2>
      <p class="content-body" style="font-size: 19px;">
        <br>The most important thing that anyone should have when embarking on a life changing "journey", whether it's making a career shift or leveling up your current career or even just getting started in something completely new, is a <b>why</b>. A powerful <b>why</b> will determine the result of that journey. If powerful enough, it can sustain you through the ups and downs that all journeys consist of, eventually getting you to your destination and beyond!... or it can lead to "burn out" and unsatisfaction. Here's why I want to get into software development<br><br> There aren't many things in this world that provide you the complete and absolute freedom and capability to create things from practically nothing like Software Development does. <br><br> There's only so much that can be done with a lump of clay/playdough. <br><br> You can only architect and build an amazing building to a certain extent until reminded of the constraints imposed upon us within this universe. <br><br> You can do only do, <i>so much</i>, of anything in this limited physical plane of existance, but there is another plane of existance... one with less constraints.. what about the <i>Digital</i> plane?<br><br>Software development is the manipulation of that digital plane of existance. It has opened up a world of near infinite opportunities to create! From a dinky little html webpage to your very own and completely immersive virtual reailty and even beyond... - the digital world is, literally, your oyster.<br><br>As fun as it is to go off on a tangeant and start creating a whole bunch of amazing, yet random things through software development, the best and most fulfilling thing, to me at least, is being able to apply that new power to create in a way that benefits someone or something. In my case, it's applying it to the benefit of the masses! My dream is to become a part of the development of products and services that will positively effect changes in its users lives! Like how Apple and Microsoft created operating systems that dropped the learning curve of using a computer far enough to <i>finally</i> get computers into the housholds of millions of everyday people. My why is to create something useful and beneficial for my fellow man (myself included!).<br><br>
      </p>
      <h2 class="content-title">My How:</h2>
       <p class="content-body" style='font-size: 19px;'>
        <br>With every why.. there must be a <i><b>how</b></i>. The <b>how</b> is the plan of action. It's the steps and checkpoints needed to direct the journey and ensure a successful arrival to the destination. Here's how I plan on breaking into Software Development.<br><br>The first order of business? Learning the basic languages of web developement! Starting with the front-end:<br><br>- HTML <br> - CSS <br> - Javascript. <br><br> I have decided that the best path to learning these, in the fastest and most productive way possible, is through the multi mini-project method, which I learned from an awesome self-taught engineer and entrepeneur, Jennifer Dewalt, in her <a href="https://jenniferdewalt.com/" title="index.html">blog</a>. It's basically creating a bunch of webpages, applying everything that I'm learning through <a href="https://www.codecademy.com" title="codecademy">Codecademy</a> and <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org" title="freecodecamp">Free Code Camp</a> and, simultaneously, also creating a portfolio of completed creations to begin building up some credibility for when it comes time to apply for jobs. I will also dabble in React, a <i><b>hot</b></i> javascript library for building better websites at a faster pace and level up my Python skills by learning the Django, Python back-end web framework.<br><br>The second order of business is to start networking. One of the most interesting and truly infromative podcasts I've come across called <a href="https://breakingintostartups.com/" title="breakingIn">Breaking Into Startups</a> - which brings on these people from underpriveleged or non-technical backgrounds and shares their own amazing journeys of how they got into tech and software development from scratch - taught me that the next most important steps to <i>break into</i> tech was networking and forming relationships with others in that position you want to be in or with like minds. Nearly ALL of the self-taught engineers brought on to speak had gotten in through the "offline" method, networking and connecting socially. So.. in order to apply that, the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/" title="">Meetup</a> app will be my best friend when it comes time to finding the events and places where web developers congregate. I plan to listen and observe, writing down unfamiliar webdev lingo, software engineering concepts, hints about what skills are most in demand and marketable right now and questions I can ask to get dialogue going. <br>Another valuable method of connecting, shared in the podcast, was contacting CEO's, VP's of Engineering and CTO's directly! Gotta try everything! <br><br>Hopefully, my DevOps and Cloud background, can give me a little boost to even get an interview. <br><br>To recap. My why is to create beneficial software products that will scratch someones itch or solve major problems. My how is hard work, smart work, determination and building relationships. The best part of any journey is knowing why it's important and then enjoying every step of the way!</p>
