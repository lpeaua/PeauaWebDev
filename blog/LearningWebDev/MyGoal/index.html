      <h2 class="content-title">My Why:</h2>
      <p class="content-body" style="font-size: 19px;">
        <br>The most important thing that anyone should have when embarking on a life changing "journey", whether it's making a career shift or leveling up your current career or even just getting started in something completely new, is a <b>why</b>. A powerful <b>why</b> will determine the result of that journey. If powerful enough, it can sustain you through the ups and downs that all journeys consist of, eventually getting you to your destination and beyond!... or it can lead to "burn out" and unsatisfaction. Here's why I want to get into software development<br><br> There aren't many things in this world that provide you the complete and absolute freedom and capability to create things from practically nothing like Software Development does. <br><br> There's only so much that can be done with a lump of clay/playdough. <br><br> You can only architect and build an amazing building to a certain extent until reminded of the constraints imposed upon us within this universe. <br><br> You can do only do, <i>so much</i>, of anything in this limited physical plane of existance, but there is another plane of existance... one with less constraints.. what about the <i>Digital</i> plane?<br><br>Software development is the manipulation of that digital plane of existance. It has opened up a world of near infinite opportunities to create! From a dinky little html webpage to your very own and completely immersive virtual reailty and even beyond... - the digital world is, literally, your oyster.<br><br>As fun as it is to go off on a tangeant and start creating a whole bunch of amazing, yet random things through software development, the best and most fulfilling thing, to me at least, is being able to apply that new power to create in a way that benefits someone or something. In my case, it's applying it to the benefit of the masses! My dream is to become a part of the development of products and services that will positively effect changes in its users lives! Like how Apple and Microsoft created operating systems that dropped the learning curve of using a computer far enough to <i>finally</i> get computers into the housholds of millions of everyday people. My why is to create something useful and beneficial for my fellow man (myself included!).<br><br>
      </p>
      <h2 class="content-title">My How:</h2>
       <p class="content-body" style='font-size: 19px;'>
        <br>With every why.. there must be a <i><b>how</b></i>. The <b>how</b> is the plan of action. It's the steps and checkpoints needed to direct the journey and ensure a successful arrival to the destination. Here's how I plan on breaking into Software Development.<br><br>The first order of business? Learning the basic languages of web developement! Starting with the front-end:<br><br>- HTML <br> - CSS <br> - Javascript. <br><br> I have decided that the best path to learning these, in the fastest and most productive way possible, is through the multi mini-project method. It's basically creating a bunch of webpages, applying the basics that I'm learning through <a href="codecademy.com" title="codecademy">Codecademy</a> and <a href="freecodecamp.com" title="freecodecamp">Free Code Camp</a>
