      <h2 class="content-title">My Pride And Joy</h2>
      <p class="content-body" style="font-size: 19px;">
        <br>My first project - which will be a perpetually ongoing project for me - is my website itslef! It's come a loooong ways since my first couple of attempts at this. My perfecionism and OCD were some of the biggest hurdles to overcome on this one. I wanted it to be an AWESOME, FULLY FEATURED and HIGHLY RESPONSIVE website that is, practically, a digital extension of me! Alas, being my very first webpage ever... and with my lack of basic design skills, I decided to stick to the good 'ol KISS philosophy!<br><br>- Keep <br>- It <br>- Simple <br>- STUPID! <br><br>After checking out some blogs of some techie content creators, I noticed that they all had really <i>really</i> elegant, yet extremely simple designs, which definitely made me feel better about giving up on all of the cool little bells and whistles I had in mind and also taught me a lesson on simplicity. The best use of my time will, <b> <i>most definitely</i></b>, not be in spending time on this website. It will be best spent learning more of the programmming languages I need to learn for front-end web development and CREATING MORE PROJECTS!!! <br> <br> My website is as basic and unresponsive as you can get without it being just straight up HTML. I decided to go with round edges, narrow body width and a little bit of drop-shadowing (which might be a little cheezy, but I'm keepin it!... for now, at least). One of the most annoying things, after I was a couple of webpages in, was the amount of repetative work I was doing to make every page as uniform as possible! <br> I know alot of web frameworks have a templating feature, which allows you to create base templates and then reference those templates in every newly created pages so that you don't have to copy and paste and adjust the uniform parts of your website over and over (such as the footer, header and navbars for example), however, at this entry-level point of my journey, I didn't want to just jump straight into a framework only for convenience sake... Gotta do things in order so I don't condfuse myself or waste even more time trying to learn something I'm not entirely ready for yet.
