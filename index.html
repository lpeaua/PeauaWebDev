        <h1>Welcome to my site!</h1>

        <div id="my-photo" class="img" ><img src="me.jpeg"></div>

        <p style="font-size:110%;">Hello! My name is Rich Peaua. I am a young, ambitious and driven human being with the burning desire to increase my capacity to contribute value to the world around me. I've struggled through life, with no college degree, from a humble help desk agent to certified and experienced Cloud Infrastructure and Devops Engineer in Silicon Valley and the Bay Area. Technology is my passion and I have, like a ravenous thirst-crazed animal hearing water flowing in the distance, rushed the waters of knowldge regarding tech and have lapped and continue to lap <i>furiously</i> with great desperation to drink in as much information as possbile to, not only know about technology, but <i>particpate</i> in its application in transforming business - such as, for example, helping a noname little start-up with a big idea to leverage cloud technology that would allow it to develop, deploy and scale their game changing application 50x faster than without the power of the cloud.<br>Within the genre of "technology", more specifically Information Technology and Software, my greatest interest has always lied in Software Developemnt. My whole life I've wanted to develop games, but after getting my hands on the ebook version of <strong>The C++ Programming Language</strong> my freshman year of highschool, written by the architect of C++ himself, Bjarne Stroustrup, I was thoroughly disheartned at the complexity I saw in the syntax of that programming language. Now, Almost a decade later and having worked exstensively with developers in my current role as Site Reliability Engineer, and having learned to script in Bash and Python, the fire to write code has rekindled and I have decided to jump
          ,head first, into full-blown web development (not into gaming so much nowadays). <br>By nature, I am a "builder", meaning,
          I LOVE building things, whether it's a handy storage shed in the backyard or a highly scalable and reliable cloud environment to host software. I have this
          insatiable desire to create and build and I am wholly convinced that software developement is the perfect outlet. From VR to mobile applications, the
          possibilities for a builder such as I are practically INFINITE. I have absolutely no experience in full-blown software development (unless you count scripting), so this will be
          a bit of a challenge and a journey for me. I will be taking the learn-by-doing project approach to developing my software skills and this website will serve to document and, hopefully,
          educate and motivate those who might also be thinking of making the dive - <i>head first</i> - into software development.
