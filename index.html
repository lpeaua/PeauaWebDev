        <p style="font-size:95%;">Hello! My name is Rich Peaua. I am a young, ambitious and driven tech professional with the burning desire to increase my capacity to contribute value to the world around me. Life hasn't been easy. Growing up, I became truly familiar with the word "hardship". Luckily, I was able to graduate from highschool but I college wasn't a viable option for me. I started out as a humble help desk agent and now I'm certified and experienced Cloud Infrastructure and Devops Engineer in Silicon Valley and the Bay Area. <br><br>Technology has been my passion.. my lifeline.. and I have, like a ravenous thirst-crazed animal hearing water flowing in the distance, rushed the waters of tech knowledge and have lapped and continue to lap up <i>furiously</i> and with great desparation as much information as possbile to, not only know about technology, but <i>participate</i> in its application in transforming business - such as, for example, helping a noname little start-up with a big idea to leverage cloud technology that would allow it to develop, deploy and scale their game changing application 50x faster than without the power of the cloud.<br><br>Within the genre of "technology", more specifically Information Technology and Software, my greatest interest has always lied in Software Development. Growing up, I dreamed of becoming a game developer, but after getting my hands on the ebook version of <strong>The C++ Programming Language</strong> my freshman year of highschool, by the architect of C++ himself, Bjarne Stroustrup, I was thoroughly disheartned at the complexity I saw in the syntax of that programming language. Now, Almost a decade later and having worked exstensively with developers in my current role, and having learned to script in Bash and Python, the fire to develop software has rekindled and I have decided to jump
          ,head first, into full-blown web development (not into gaming anymore). <br><br>The purpose of this website is to document my journey into my newly rekindled interest, hopefully serving to educate and motivate others contemplating making the same move, and also to provide entry level knowledge of Devops/Cloud Engineering for newbie techies trying to break into the industry.
          <br><br>Please, feel free to reach out to me via <a href="mailto:rich@peaua.io">e-mail</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rich-peaua-004492125/" title="linkedin">LinkedIn</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/peauaio" title="">Twitter</a> if you'd like to connect!
