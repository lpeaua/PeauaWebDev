          Hello! My name is Rich Peaua. I am a young, ambitious and driven tech professional (and one of an extremely rare number of Polynesians [Hawaiians, Samoans, Tongans, Tahitians etc..] in Tech) with the burning desire to increase my capacity to contribute value to the world around me. Life hasn't been easy. Growing up, I became truly familiar with the word "hardship". Luckily, I was able to graduate from highschool but college just wasn't a viable option for me at that time. The most viable option that I did find, however, was breaking into Tech. I started out as a humble help-desk agent at barely $12/hour and now I'm a certified Professional Cloud Architect and Devops Engineer in Silicon Valley and the Bay Area making 6 figures!! <br><br>Technology has been my passion.. my lifeline.. and I have, like a ravenous thirst-crazed animal hearing water flowing in the distance, rushed the waters of tech knowledge and have lapped and continue to lap up <i>furiously</i> and with great desparation as much information as possbile to, not only know about the latest tech, but to actually <i>participate</i> in its application in transforming the way business and organizations operate and provide their services - such as, for example, how a noname little start-up with a big idea can leverage cloud technology to develop, deploy and scale their game changing application <strong>OVER 20x FASTER</strong> than without the power of the cloud.<br><br>Within the great scheme of "Tech", more specifically Information Technology and Software, my greatest interest has always lied in Software Development. Growing up, I dreamed of becoming a game developer, but after getting my hands on the ebook version of <strong>The C++ Programming Language</strong> my freshman year of highschool, by the architect of C++ himself, Bjarne Stroustrup, I was thoroughly disheartned at the complexity of <i>just the words</i> I read on the first page! Let alone the complexity of C++. Now, Almost a decade later and having worked exstensively with developers in my current role, and having learned to script in Bash and Python, the fire to develop software has rekindled and I have decided to jump
          ,head first, into full-blown web development (I might move up to game dev sometime later!). <br><br>The purpose of this website is to document my journey into my newly rekindled interest, hopefully serving to educate and motivate others contemplating making the same move, and also to share my knowledge of Devops/Cloud Engineering, Python and IT in general with newbies, wannabes and, most especially, my polynesian brothers and sisters trying to break into this industry! You can find these things in my <a href="blog/" title="blog">blog</a>.
          <br><br>I'm here to <strong>learn</strong>, <strong>teach</strong>, <strong>grow</strong>, <strong>motivate</strong> and <strong>contribute</strong> so if you have any questions or if you're of a like mind and wish to connect, please, feel free to reach out to me via <a href="mailto:rich@peaua.io">e-mail</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rich-peaua-004492125/" title="linkedin">LinkedIn</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/peauaio" title="">Twitter</a>!
